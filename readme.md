## weather for the mountains

Pull the forecasts from NDFD and write an html summary file:

  `./scrape.py --outfname _html/weather.html`

To add a location, edit `all-locations.csv`.

The current forecast is [here](http://psathyrella.github.io/weatherscraper/weather.html).

## inspiration

I started with the [lost in the mountains](http://lost-in-the-mountains.com/washington_climbing.php) location list, and started adding information.
