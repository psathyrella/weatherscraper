## weather for the mountains

To pull forecasts from NDFD and write the information to an html file:

    ./scrape.py --outfname _html/weather.html

To add or remove locations, edit `all-locations.csv`.

Or, just look at the current forecast [here](http://psathyrella.github.io/weatherscraper/weather.html).

## inspiration

I started with the [lost in the mountains](http://lost-in-the-mountains.com/washington_climbing.php) location list, and started adding information.
